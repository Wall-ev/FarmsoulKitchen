## Notice
  - Due to the author's personal reasons, the development progress will be extremely slow (maybe the pit will be abandoned...)
  - If you want to play as soon as possible, you can click `Star` and find the latest version of the auto-build on the [Releases](https://github.com/Wall-ev/TouhouLittleMaidAddon/releases) page
  - If you download the auto-build version ,you need to make backups before playing to avoid losing your property.
